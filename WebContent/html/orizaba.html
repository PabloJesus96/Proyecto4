The Orizba, an ultra deepwater drillship equipped to drill in 3,048 m (10,000 ft) of water, 
is located in the deepest part of the Sigsbee Field. At its largest point, the field contains 
a gas column 1,450 meters (4,760 ft.) deep with a 200 meters (660 ft.) deep oil rim below it,
 estimated to contain approximately 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas.
  The Orizba is positioned directly over this gas column and is set to produce this gas as well
   as more than 4.2 tons of crude oil per year.
